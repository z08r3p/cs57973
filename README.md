AERO 4300 - Composite Manufacturing and Design Project
Introduction:  
The AERO 4300 Design Project is a semester long project, in which you cover the complete composite design process from material selection to final design. The project is assessed in two parts:·   Part A: Project poster (10%)·   Part B: Video presentation (25%)
The project is an individual (not group work) project and based on a “real-world” problem. It is important to note that there is no single correct solution and therefore it is highly unlikely that multiple people arrive at the exact same design. Discussion between students is encouraged - copying is misconduct. The use of AI tools is not permitted, with the exception of tools used for spell checking and grammar.
Please note that this problem is based on a real-world application, but some assumptions and constraints are imaginary.  
Problem statement: 
The Starship is a ground-breaking new two-stage reusable launch vehicle designed by SpaceX. With a total height of 121m and a mass of 5,000 tons it is the largest and most powerful rocket to ever fly (see Figure 1 and 2). Whilst the Starship consist of two stages, for all aspects other than the introduction of Part A, the focus will be on the second stage (see Figure 3).
The Starship makes very limited use of composite materials. Instead, the design team opted for the now famous stainless-steel design. What many people don’t realise, is that initial design concepts for the Starship envisaged a ‘all-composites’ solution.
In this project you will dive deeper into the use of composites for next-generation launch vehicles such as Starship. In Part A of the project you will develop the background understanding related to the starship and its design. You will explore the drivers for/against the use of composite materials and discuss the rationale behind SpaceX’s decision to opt for a metal design. In Part B, you will develop your own hypothetical concept for a ‘all-composite’ Starship design’. This involves the in-depth material selection, development of a manufacturing concept and preliminary structural design.Figure 1: Spice and payload comparisoMartinn with other launch platforms
